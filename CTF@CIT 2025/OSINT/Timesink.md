There is a bridge in this video:Â [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9g0U-M2McQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9g0U-M2McQ). What street is the bridge on?

# Solve
A quick google search for "where was Lorn - Timesink filmed" gets us to [here](https://www.promonews.tv/videos/2020/03/25/lorn-timesink-pavel-brenner/63991) which stated that the music video was filmed in Oregon.

Using the following image along with the search parameter "Oregon" we were able to find the following post [here](https://structurae.net/en/structures/little-nestucca-river-bridge-ii) which got me to Little Nestucca River Bridge II.

Looking up "Little Nestucca River Bridge II" didn't get me to the right street. But dropping into maps and following the road led to me to the correct bridge
