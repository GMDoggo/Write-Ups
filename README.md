My goal is to actively participate in CTFs to sharpen my offensive security skills, tackle complex challenges, and stay up-to-date with emerging threats. I aim to document my learning process through detailed write-ups, sharing insights and solutions to enhance both my understanding and the broader security community's knowledge.
