# **HTB Operation Blackout Summary**

HTB Operation Blackout marked my most meaningful Capture the Flag (CTF) experience to date, representing my company in a competitive and collaborative environment. With 4,549 participants across 795 teams, the event offered a dynamic mix of technical challenges that tested a wide array of cybersecurity skills. More than just a competition, it was a powerful opportunity for growth—allowing me to assess my current capabilities while rapidly gaining exposure to unfamiliar areas of cybersecurity.

## My Experience

Competing alongside coworkers, I contributed to our team’s strong finish—placing **140th out of 795 teams**, which put us in the top tier of performers. Throughout the event, I focused heavily on exploring and solving challenges in categories that were new to me, including **Cloud, FullPWN, Hardware, ICS, and Machine Learning**. This not only expanded my own skillset but also created space for some of the less experienced team members to get involved and secure wins of their own. Supporting and mentoring teammates throughout the event was just as rewarding as capturing flags myself.

While I brought strength to traditional categories, my real focus was on pushing into areas where I had less experience. Diving into hardware hacking, cloud misconfigurations, and even industrial control systems (ICS) provided hands-on insight into areas not typically encountered in day-to-day work. The event challenged me to quickly learn, adapt, and apply knowledge under pressure—exactly the kind of environment where growth thrives.

## Summary

HTB Operation Blackout was both a technical challenge and a professional milestone. Representing my company, I was proud to contribute to our top 18% finish while broadening my expertise across several advanced and emerging cybersecurity domains. The competition deepened my passion for lifelong learning in this field, and I remain committed to continuing my development through future CTFs and hands-on exploration of complex topics. Each challenge reaffirmed my drive to keep growing, keep learning, and help others do the same.
