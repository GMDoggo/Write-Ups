Our Intel-Team has intercepted a VoIP call made by a high-ranking government official. During the call, the official accessed a secure government IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, which requires a password to proceed. Your mission is to analyze the captured call and determine the password he entered. Flag format: HTB{ACCESS_KEY}


# Solve

Filter for VOIP `sip || rtp`

using wireshark we can listen or playback the audio.

Use the menu:
- **Telephony â†’ VoIP Calls**
- Identify the active call, select it, then click **"Player"**.
- Phone dial sounds can be decoded based on their frequency

Lets export this and see if we can get the access key from the dial tones an example can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/forensic-methods-determine-phone-numbers-called-from-keypad-todd/)

In the following example is the first digit

On the first peak we get 698 and on the second we get 1207 so this is probably a 1

Then rinse and repeat for all digits. or just use a DTMF analzer found [here](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html)
