## Challenge Description

Valentine the bee needs to visit all 50 waterlilies around her beehive, starting and ending at the beehive located at coordinates (0,0). Each flower must be visited exactly once, and the total path distance must be less than 1400 units.

This is a classic **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** - find the shortest route that visits all points exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Solution Approach

Since TSP is NP-hard and we have 50 points, finding the optimal solution would take too long. Instead, I used a combination of heuristics to find a "good enough" solution:

### 1. Multiple Starting Strategies

Instead of always starting from the beehive, I tried:

- Standard nearest neighbor from beehive
- Starting from the flower closest to origin
- Starting from several different flowers randomly

**Why this works**: Sometimes starting the tour from a strategically located flower produces a shorter total path than always beginning at the beehive.

### 2. Nearest Neighbor Heuristic

For each starting approach:

- Begin at chosen starting point
- Always visit the nearest unvisited flower
- Continue until all flowers are visited
- Return to beehive

**Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) - fast enough for 50 points

### 3. 2-opt Local Optimization

After finding an initial solution, improve it using 2-opt:

- Take any two edges in the current path
- Remove them and reconnect in the alternate way
- If the new path is shorter, keep it
- Repeat until no improvements are found

**Example of 2-opt**:

```
Original: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> A
Remove edges: B-C and D-E
Reconnect: A -> B -> D -> C -> E -> A
```

This eliminates "crossing" paths that unnecessarily increase distance.

## Code Implementation

```

import random

    """Calculate Euclidean distance between two points"""
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

        flower_idx = path[i] - 1  # Convert to 0-indexed
        total += distance(current_pos, points[flower_idx])
        current_pos = points[flower_idx]
    
    # Return to beehive
