# About
My buddy and I were walking around a shopping mall during our visit to Germany. While we were there, we got really hungry and decided to go into a supermarket to buy some fresh bread and d√∂ner. When we entered the store, we were pleasantly surprised to find a bread slicing machine! That was very convenient. We wanted to go back, but we had forgotten where the store was! Silly Americans, right? Anyway, we got lucky because my buddy happened to take a photo in the area because he liked the architecture. Can you help us find the supermarket so we can buy some more fresh bread before we fly back?
