I participated in [PlaidCTF](https://plaidctf.com/), a highly respected capture-the-flag competition hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s elite hacking team, PPP (Plaid Parliament of Pwning), known for their multiple DEFCON wins. This CTF is notorious for its difficulty, and going into it, I knew I’d be out of my depth—but I was determined to contribute.

Over the weekend, I led the effort on one of the challenges, _PlaidApple_, which involved decrypting a hidden string embedded within a video file. It pushed me way out of my comfort zone, but after hours of analyzing frames, scripting, and listening to “Bad Apple” on loop, I managed to crack it.

In the end, our team placed 55th out of 903 registered teams—a result I'm incredibly proud of given the caliber of the competition. While the challenge was tough and at times overwhelming, it was a fantastic learning experience and a genuinely fun weekend.
