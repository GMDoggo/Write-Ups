# Synopsis
EncryptedScroll is a Very Easy reversing challenge. Players will analyze some basic arithmetic to extract the flag from the binary.
## Skills Required

- Familiarity with static and dynamic analysis tools
- Knowledge of simple obfuscation techniques
- Ability to bypass basic anti-debugging mechanisms

## Skills Learned

- How to analyze a compiled binary to extract hardcoded secrets
- Understanding string manipulation and character encoding in compiled programs
# Solution
Upon running the provided binary, we are presented with a prompt, suggesting we need to input a "mage's spell" to proceed.

A quick examination of the file type reveals that it is an ELF executable.

Time to load up GHIDRA and get to work analyzing the code. (Thank god this was not stripped)

## Analysis
Within GHIDRA, we identify the `main` function and pinpoint the key function calls:

- display_scroll(); // Display the scroll message 
- printf(&DAT_00102220); // Display a message Assume its The ancient scroll hums with magical energy. Enter the mageâ€™s spell: 
- isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00102268, local_48); // Read user input (the mage's spell) 
- decrypt_message(local_48); // Decrypt and validate input (edited)

Inspecting the `decrypt_message` function reveals the following crucial operations:

* `local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)`: This retrieves the stack canary value, a security measure against buffer overflows. Since this isn't a pwn challenge, it's not our primary concern.
* ``builtin_strncpy(local_38, "IUC|t2nqm4\`gm5h\`5s2uin4u2d~", 0x1c)``: This copies an encrypted string into the `local_38` buffer.
* The following loop decrypts the string:
```c
for (local_3c = 0; local_38[local_3c] != '\0'; local_3c = local_3c + 1) { local_38[local_3c] = local_38[local_3c] + -1; }
```
This loop iterates through the encrypted string, subtracting 1 from the ASCII value of each character. This indicates a ROT-1 cipher.

To decrypt the string, I created a simple Python script:
```python
encrypted_str = "IUC|t2nqm4`gm5h`5s2uin4u2d~"
decrypted_str = ''.join(chr(ord(c) - 1) for c in encrypted_str)
print(decrypted_str)
```

Running this script yields the decrypted flag:
