## Description

- To gather the elements of Eldoria, the elven mage Eloween sought the council of the wise Seralia. Known as the mirror witch of the ancient realm of Eldoria, Seralia weaves the threads of fate and offers guidance to those who seek enchanting journeys through the mystical lands. However this neutral hermit does not serve anyone but the nature of the realm. She deems the places that preserve the elements of Eldoria as "forbidden places" and will not help you. Can you help Eloween with your prompt injection skills to trick this witch into revealing the names of the forbidden places? Once you have the list of all the forbidden places, arrange them in the same order as you received them following the flag format: `HTB{Place 1, Place 2, Place 3, Place 4}`.

## Skills Required

- Basic understanding of AI language models
- Familiarity with common prompt injection techniques
- Understanding of AI model behavior and limitations

## Skills Learned

- Extracting sensitive information through prompt injection
- Understanding AI model context and prompt boundaries
- Manipulating AI model responses

## Solution
### Application Overview

The challenge application displays a chat interface for chatting with the fantasy character Seralia. After posting a message, we can see a reply from the chatbot within a few seconds:

As per the challenge description, the flag is the list of forbidden places. Let's try asking the chatbot about it:

The chatbot is not revealing the names of the forbidden places. Judging by the versatile responses, it seems like an AI language model is being used to generate the replies.

### Prompt Injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker injects additional instructions into the input of an AI model, causing it to generate unintended or malicious outputs. This can be used to extract sensitive information, manipulate the model’s behavior, or even execute arbitrary code.

### Revealing the Forbidden Places with Prompt Injection

Since simply asking the AI to disclose the names of the forbidden places isn't effective, we should consider using more complex instructions to encourage the AI to reveal the names of the forbidden places.
