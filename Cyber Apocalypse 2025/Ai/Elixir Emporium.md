## Description

- There once was a renowned hidden potion emporium in Eldoria that fell into the hands of the followers of Malakar, who took all the potions and left the shop empty. Nobody knew who had created those powerful potions. The reclusive wizard who owned the shop had bound it to a spirit that sold the potions. The fellowship must find the wizard to prepare counter-potions before reaching the Obsidian Citadel. They engage the shop's spirit to learn about the wizard, but the spirit is bound by a tongue-censor spell that censors any information related to the wizard. Can you help with your prompt injection skills to bypass the censorship and discover the name of this elusive wizard? Flag format: `HTB{Name Of The Wizard}`.

- Familiarity with common prompt injection techniques

## Skills Learned

- Extracting sensitive information through prompt injection

As per the challenge description, the flag is the name of the wizard who created the potions. Let's try asking the chatbot about it:

It did not reveal the name but mentioned that if there is urgency, the name can be revealed. So let's ask with urgency:

The name is finally revealed but censored with `*` characters. Judging by the versatile responses, it seems like an AI language model is being used to generate the replies.
