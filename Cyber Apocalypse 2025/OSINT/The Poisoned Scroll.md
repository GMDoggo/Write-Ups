## Synopsis

In her crystal-lit sanctum, Nyla examines reports of a series of magical attacks against the ruling council of Germinia, Eldoria's eastern ally. The attacks all bear the signature of the Shadow Ravens, a notorious cabal of dark mages known for their espionage across the realms. Her fingers trace connections between affected scrolls and contaminated artifacts, seeking the specific enchantment weapon deployed against the Germinian leaders. The runes along her sleeves pulse rhythmically as she sifts through intercepted messages and magical residue analyses from the attack sites. Her network of information crystals glows brighter as patterns emerge in the magical attacksâ€”each victim touched by the same corrupting spell, though disguised under different manifestations. Finally, the name of the specific dark enchantment materializes in glowing script above her central crystal. Another dangerous threat identified by Eldoria's master information seeker, who knows that even the most sophisticated magical weapons leave distinctive traces for those who know how to read the patterns of corruption.

### Step 1 

I first started by breaking down the synopsis into chunks and trying to make sense of it. My first though was Germinia was Germany. Then when it mentions Shadow Ravens I knew we were going to be looking for an APT. Then it specifies the attacks were against the "ruling council" or political figures of Germany.

### Step 2 

Search google for apt attack against germany against political parties = win
