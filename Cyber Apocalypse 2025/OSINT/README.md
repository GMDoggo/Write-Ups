## About
This category was my favorite, as it was the most beginner-friendly and aligned perfectly with my passion for data exploration. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge of digging through information, and finding locations is a fun and rewarding task to kick off the competition weekend. Overall, we managed to complete the entire category in under five hours. We were the 7th team to solve _Hillside Haven_, the 9th to crack _Poisoned Scroll_, and the 29th to complete _Ancient Citadel_.
